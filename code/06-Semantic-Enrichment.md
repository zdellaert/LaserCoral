## 0.2 Managing Packages Using Renv

To run this code in my project using the renv environment, run the
following lines of code

``` r
install.packages("renv") #install the package on the new computer (may not be necessary if renv bootstraps itself as expected)
renv::restore() #reinstall all the package versions in the renv lockfile
```

## 0.4 Description of pipeline

I am going to perform functional enrichment of GO terms using
[ViSEAGO](https://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13040-019-0204-1).

I am following this vignette:
<http://bioconductor.unipi.it/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/ViSEAGO/inst/doc/ViSEAGO.html>.

## 0.5 Load in reference files and differential expression data

In the next chunk I am loading in my DESeq data. These results are
ordered by adjusted p-value. As a reminder, negative LFC = higher in
Aboral tissue, and positive LFC = higher in Oral tissue.

``` r
#load in DESeq results
DESeq <- read.csv("../output_RNA/differential_expression/DESeq_results.csv", header = TRUE) %>% dplyr::rename("query" ="X")

#make dataframes of just differentially expressed genes for each LFC direction
DE_05_Aboral <- DESeq %>% filter(padj < 0.05 & log2FoldChange > 0)
DE_05_OralEpi <- DESeq %>% filter(padj < 0.05& log2FoldChange < 0)

#load in annotation data 
annot_tab <- read.delim("../references/annotation/protein-GO.tsv") %>% dplyr::rename(GOs = GeneOntologyIDs)

#filter annotation data for just expressed genes with GO annotations
annot_tab <- annot_tab %>% filter(query %in% DESeq$query) 

annot_tab$GOs <- gsub("; ", ";", annot_tab$GOs)
annot_tab$GOs[annot_tab$GOs==""] <- NA
annot_tab <- annot_tab %>% filter(!is.na(GOs))

nrow(annot_tab)
```

    ## [1] 10638

``` r
nrow(annot_tab)/nrow(DESeq)
```

    ## [1] 0.7354812

10638/14464 genes in our dataset have GO information in this file. That
is 74%.

``` r
sum(annot_tab$query %in% DE_05_Aboral$query)
```

    ## [1] 545

``` r
sum(annot_tab$query %in% DE_05_Aboral$query)/nrow(DE_05_Aboral)
```

    ## [1] 0.6778607

``` r
sum(annot_tab$query %in% DE_05_OralEpi$query)
```

    ## [1] 1979

``` r
sum(annot_tab$query %in% DE_05_OralEpi$query)/nrow(DE_05_OralEpi)
```

    ## [1] 0.7062812

545/804 genes that are significantly upregulated in the Aboral tissue
have annotation information. That is 68% of the genes.

1979/2802 genes that are significantly upregulated in the Oral Epidermis
tissue have annotation information. That is 71% of the genes.

## 0.6 Create custom GO annotation file for ViSEAGO

``` r
##Get a list of GO Terms for all genes
annots <- annot_tab %>% dplyr::select(query,GOs) %>% dplyr::rename("GO.terms" = GOs)

# format into the format required by ViSEAGO for custom mappings
Custom_GOs <- annots %>%
  # Separate GO terms into individual rows
  separate_rows(GO.terms, sep = ";") %>%
  # Add necessary columns
  mutate(
    taxid = "pacuta",
    gene_symbol = query,
    evidence = "SwissProt"
  ) %>%
  # Rename columns
  dplyr::rename(
    gene_id = query,
    GOID = GO.terms
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(taxid, gene_id, gene_symbol, GOID, evidence)

Custom_GOs_valid <- Custom_GOs %>% filter(GOID %in% keys(GO.db))

write.table(Custom_GOs_valid, "../output_RNA/differential_expression/semantic-enrichment/custom_GOs.txt",row.names = FALSE, sep = "\t", quote = FALSE,col.names=TRUE)

length(unique(Custom_GOs$gene_id))
```

    ## [1] 10638

``` r
length(unique(Custom_GOs_valid$gene_id))
```

    ## [1] 10637

We seem to have lost one gene when filtering for valid GO terms, so I
need to account for that below.

### 0.6.1 load the file into ViSEAGO

``` r
Custom_Pacuta <- ViSEAGO::Custom2GO("../output_RNA/differential_expression/semantic-enrichment/custom_GOs.txt")
```

    ## 'select()' returned 1:1 mapping between keys and columns

``` r
myGENE2GO_Pacuta <- ViSEAGO::annotate(
    id="pacuta",
    Custom_Pacuta
)
```

## 0.7 Create gene lists for enrichment

``` r
selection <- DESeq %>% filter(query %in% Custom_GOs_valid$gene_id) %>% 
                       mutate(DE_05_Aboral = ifelse(query %in% DE_05_Aboral$query, 1,0)) %>%
                       mutate(DE_05_Oral = ifelse(query %in% DE_05_OralEpi$query, 1,0)) %>%
                       mutate(expressed = 1)

selection_Aboral <- selection %>% pull(DE_05_Aboral) %>% as.factor()
names(selection_Aboral) <- selection %>% pull(query)

selection_Oral <- selection %>% pull(DE_05_Oral) %>% as.factor()
names(selection_Oral) <- selection %>% pull(query)

expressed <- selection %>% pull(expressed) %>% as.factor()
names(expressed) <- selection %>% pull(query)
```

## 0.8 create topGO objects and perform enrichment using topGO wrapped by ViSEAGO

``` r
#create topgo object using custom mappings
# BP_Aboral <- new("topGOdata",
#               ontology = "BP",
#               allGenes = selection_Aboral,
#               nodeSize = 5,
#               gene2GO = geneID2GO,
#               annot = annFUN.gene2GO) 

# create viseago object
selection <- names(selection_Aboral)[selection_Aboral==1]
background <- names(expressed)

BP_Aboral <- ViSEAGO::create_topGOdata(
    geneSel=selection,
    allGenes=background,
    gene2GO=myGENE2GO_Pacuta, 
    ont="BP",
    nodeSize=5
)
```
