Bismark report for: data_WGBS/trimmed_V3_LCM_25_S6_R1_001.fastq.gz and data_WGBS/trimmed_V3_LCM_25_S6_R2_001.fastq.gz (version: v0.23.1)
Bismark was run with HISAT2 against the bisulfite genome of /project/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/zdellaert/LaserCoral/references/Bisulfite_Genome_hisat2/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 -p 4 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --maxins 500 --no-softclip --omit-sec-seq
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	161009075
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	46539640
Mapping efficiency:	28.9% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	102938746
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	11530689
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	153

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	23271146	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	23268341	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
