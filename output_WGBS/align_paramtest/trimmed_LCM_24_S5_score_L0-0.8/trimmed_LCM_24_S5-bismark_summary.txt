Bowtie 2 seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.5.2])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/modules/uri_apps/software/SAMtools/1.14-GCC-11.2.0/bin/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is references/	(absolute path is '/project/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/zdellaert/LaserCoral/references/)'
FastQ format assumed (by default)
Processing sequences up to read no. 10000 from the input file
Attention: using more than 4 cores per alignment thread has been reported to have diminishing returns. If possible try to limit -p to a value of 4
Each Bowtie 2 instance is going to be run with 8 threads. Please monitor performance closely and tune down if necessary!

Input files to be analysed (in current folder '/project/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/zdellaert/LaserCoral'):
data_WGBS/trimmed_LCM_24_S5_R1_001.fastq.gz
data_WGBS/trimmed_LCM_24_S5_R2_001.fastq.gz
Library is assumed to be strand-specific (directional), alignments to strands complementary to the original top or bottom strands will be ignored (i.e. not performed!)
Output will be written into the directory: /project/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/zdellaert/LaserCoral/output_WGBS/align/trimmed_LCM_24_S5_score_L0-0.8/
Setting parallelization to single-threaded (default)

Summary of all aligner options:	-q --score-min L,0,-0.8 -p 8 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Current working directory is: /project/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/zdellaert/LaserCoral

Now reading in and storing sequence information of the genome specified in: /project/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/zdellaert/LaserCoral/references/

Single-core mode: setting pid to 1
