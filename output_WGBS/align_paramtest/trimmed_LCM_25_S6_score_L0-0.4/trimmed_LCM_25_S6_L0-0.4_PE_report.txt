Bismark report for: data_WGBS/trimmed_LCM_25_S6_R1_001.fastq.gz and data_WGBS/trimmed_LCM_25_S6_R2_001.fastq.gz (version: v0.23.1)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /project/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/zdellaert/LaserCoral/references/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.4 -p 8 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	10000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	3505
Mapping efficiency:	35.0% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	5549
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	946
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	1711	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	1794	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
